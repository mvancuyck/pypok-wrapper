It consists of a collection of IDL and Fortran 90 subroutines.

(1) F90 Compilation
--------------------

- Edit your own Makefile. A few examples are provided in /F90:
Poker/F90/Makefile
Poker/F90/Makefile.example
Poker/F90/Makefile.franklin
Poker/F90/myoldMakefile
Poker/F90/Makefile.inf-calcul1


(2) IDL setup:
--------------
- Insert the following lines in your $IDL_STARTUP:
defsysv, "!poker", getenv("POKER_DIR") ; this should point to the current directory where this file is located
!path = !path + ':' + expand_path("+"+!poker+"/IDL")                                                                                              
poker_init


(3) Test:
---------
- /IDL/poker_example.pro guides the user through the estimation of the power
  spectrum and the associated covariance matrix of two example data sets
  provided in the directory /Data.
